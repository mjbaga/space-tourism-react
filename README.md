# Space Tourism with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Please check the finished site at [https://mjbaga.github.io/space-tourism-react/](https://mjbaga.github.io/space-tourism-react/).

This is from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and their challenge for the [Space Tourism Website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).

This project was done with React and with CSS modules.

Hope this codebase helps fellow developers learning React. Any improvements, feel free to let me know on my email [mjdbaga@gmail.com](mailto:mjdbaga@gmail.com).

Thank you!
